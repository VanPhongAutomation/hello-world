# hello-world
This is my first github repository
Hello everyone;
I am an electrical engineer.
My jobs have some relations with codes and codings.
After years of working, my job seems to be too hard for an old man like me to continue.
I decided to let myself into a whole new world, the world of codes and codings.
Because my body ages faster than my mind and my imagination.
This will change my life forever.
Thank you if you reading this.
